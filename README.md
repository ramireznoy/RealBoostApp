## How to start this project

*This is a Ionic project*.

You need to install a couple of packages before test the code
1. Be sure to install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Once NodeJS is installed, run from the command line

```bash
npm install -g ionic cordova
```
3. Now you can clone the project as usual(Ah! be sure to have Git installed also...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NGBytesLLC/RealBoostApp
```

It is Done! Now you can test teh code and your changes launching the built-in server from the command line. Go to the project root and run

```bash
ionic serve
```

To test for specific platforms you can use:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
